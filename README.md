# Air Quality Analysis Project (In Progress)

This repository contains an ongoing analysis of an **Air Quality dataset from Kaggle**. The goal of this project is to explore air quality data, understand relationships between variables, and build predictive models for air pollution levels.

## Project Overview
The dataset includes daily air quality measurements, with variables such as:  
- **Ozone**: Daily ozone concentration (ppb)  
- **Solar.R**: Solar radiation (langley)  
- **Wind**: Wind speed (mph)  
- **Temp**: Temperature (°F)  
- **Month**: Month of observation  
- **Day**: Day of observation  

## Work Completed
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Histograms and summary statistics for each variable  
  - Identification of missing values and potential outliers  
  - Initial correlation checks between variables  

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  - **Linear Regression**: Built a model to predict Ozone levels; calculated in-sample and out-of-sample Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - **Regression Tree**: Built a decision tree for prediction  
  - **Random Forest**: Implemented to improve predictive accuracy
