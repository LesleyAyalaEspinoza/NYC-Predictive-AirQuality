# In Progress – Air Quality Predictive Analysis
This repository contains an ongoing analysis of an Air Quality dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore air quality data, understand relationships between variables, and build predictive models for air pollution levels.

Project Overview
The dataset includes daily air quality measurements, with variables such as:
Ozone: Daily ozone concentration 
Solar.R: Solar radiation 
Wind: Wind speed (mph)
Temp: Temperature (°F)
Month: Month of observation
Day: Day of observation

#Work Completed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histograms and summary statistics for each variable
Identification of missing values and potential outliers
Initial correlation checks between variables
Predictive Modeling
Linear Regression: Built a model to predict Ozone levels. Calculated in-sample and out-of-sample Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Regression Tree: Built a decision tree for prediction
Random Forest: Implemented to improve predictive accuracy
